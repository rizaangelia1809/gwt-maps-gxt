== Release 1.0.0.Beta3 (released March 3, 2009) ==

=== API Changes ===

  * The current position is stored in the MapMenuController, thus, every OverlayMenuTipController needs a reference to this class instead of a reference to the MapWidget [http://code.google.com/p/gwt-maps-gxt/source/detail?r=26 r26]

=== Bug fixes ===

  * OverlayMenuTipController is only listening to MapMouseMove if Mouse is over the Overlay. [http://code.google.com/p/gwt-maps-gxt/source/detail?r=26 r26]

  * Tool tips and menus were visible at the same time. [http://code.google.com/p/gwt-maps-gxt/source/detail?r=21 r21]

  * mapDragStart now hides Menu (did not work on IE) [http://code.google.com/p/gwt-maps-gxt/source/detail?r=20 r20]

  * MarkerMenuTipController.detach() did not call super.detach() [http://code.google.com/p/gwt-maps-gxt/source/detail?r=25 r25]
